                This initiative boosted sales for memberships, supplements, and energy beverages. By leveraging real-time analytical tools, 
                We refined our sales strategies to overcome the unique market challenges of 2021, resulting in a 12% decrease in customer acquisition costs and a 20% increase 
                in membership sales by the end of summer. My core responsibilities included driving membership and sales growth post-COVID-19 reopening, educating and 
                retaining clients, and upselling additional services such as personal training and supplements to increase the lifetime value of our clients. The Strategies we implemented we're driven By consumer behavior shifts experienced post pandemic. 
                In hindsight, some of these marketing strategies seem obvious, but at the time they were just a bet.
